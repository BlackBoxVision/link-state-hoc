The idea of this module started from this post **[Using linkState in your React Components to simplify event handlers](https://medium.com/@jonatan_salas/using-linkstate-in-your-react-components-to-simplify-event-handlers-9d157cb75082#.ck4t4rij1)** 

Also, this could be an upgrade from the [**linkState** mixin](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/two-way-binding-helpers.html).
